## 6. Key Insights & Recommendations

### Market Gaps & Opportunities

1. **Pricing Sweet Spot:** Market has free option (BetterSTR) and expensive option (TouchStay). Gap exists in $5-10/month range for budget-conscious hosts who want more than free.

2. **Offline-First Approach:** TouchStay's offline accessibility is unique. Most competitors require internet. Opportunity to differentiate with robust offline features.

3. **Sustainability Angle:** No competitor emphasizes eco-friendly aspects (vs printed guidebooks). Opportunity to position as "green" solution.

4. **Host Education:** Market lacks comprehensive onboarding. Opportunity to create "Vacation Rental Academy" with free courses.

5. **Niche Targeting:** Competitors target all vacation rentals. Opportunity to specialize (e.g., "Best for Pet-Friendly Properties", "Best for International Hosts").

### Competitive Positioning Recommendations

**Do NOT compete on:**
- Price (BetterSTR is free)
